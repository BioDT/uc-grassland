# loading copernicus pck not needed here, because it is installed directly in the .venv 
# for instant updates via command by these 2 steps in the terminal:
#        1. activate .venv by:
#              ./.venv/Scripts/activate
#        2. with .venv activated, install copernicus by: 
#              pip install -e ../general-copernicus-weather-data
#
# but reading from git should be possible via this line here:
#        copernicus @ git+https://github.com/BioDT/general-copernicus-weather-data.git@main
